## Lessons Learned
There are so many ways to go about designing an application meant to navigate
through a database. It is interesting to pick up one of these projects where
someone else has left off. It was also interesting to blend your own work with
someone else's work. Adding the need for coordination between team members over
a weekend homework project was a small challenge, but absolutely doable. Overall
this Application functions, but would benefit from some CSS and Bootstrap.
